The field focuses on communication between computers and humans in natural language and NLP is all about making computers understand and generate human language. Applications of NLP techniques include voice assistants like Amazon\\'s Alexa and Apple\\'s Siri, but also things like machine translation and text-filtering.\\n\\nNLP has heavily benefited from recent advances in machine learning, especially from deep learning techniques. The field is divided into the three parts:\\nHuman language is special for several reasons. It is specifically constructed to convey the speaker/writer\\'s meaning. It is a complex system, although little children can learn it pretty quickly.\\n\\nAnother remarkable thing about human language is that it is all about symbols. According to Chris Manning, a machine learning professor at Stanford, it is a discrete, symbolic, categorical signaling system. This means we can convey the same meaning in different ways (i.e., speech, gesture, signs, etc.) The encoding by the human brain is a continuous pattern of activation by which the symbols are transmitted via continuous signals of sound and vision.\\n\\nUnderstanding human language is considered a difficult task due to its complexity. For example, there is an infinite number of different ways to arrange words in a sentence. Also, words can have several meanings and contextual information is necessary to correctly interpret sentences. Every language is more or less unique and ambiguous. Just take a look at the following newspaper headline \"The Popeâs baby steps on gays.\" This sentence clearly has two very different interpretations, which is a pretty good example of the challenges in NLP.\\n\\nNote that a perfect understanding of language by a computer would result in an AI that can process the whole information that is available on the internet, which in turn would probably result in artificial general intelligence.\\n\\nIII. SYNTACTIC & SEMANTIC ANALYSIS\\nSyntactic analysis (syntax) and semantic analysis (semantic) are the two primary techniques that lead to the understanding of natural language. Language is a set of valid sentences, but what makes a sentence valid? Syntax and semantics.\\n\\nSyntax is the grammatical structure of the text, whereas semantics is the meaning being conveyed. A sentence that is syntactically correct, however, is not always semantically correct. For example, âcows flow supremelyâ is grammatically valid (subject\\u200aâ\\u200averb\\u200aâ\\u200aadverb) but it doesn\\'t make any sense.'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":31}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"vGWLDSNdh4Hy","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1619807774024,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1305,"user":{"displayName":"18_Swapnil Pradeep","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ce1wky-NHO4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAugM/Lfi8GShrm1Y/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"12112827158399341463"}},"outputId":"dfa34237-9842-42fb-97a2-52005f8a7186"},"source":["f = open('NLP.txt', 'rU')\n","for line in f:\n","  print(line.strip())"],"execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Natural language processing (NLP) is the intersection of computer science, linguistics and machine learning.

The field is divided into the three parts:\n","Human language is special for several reasons. It is specifically constructed to convey the speaker/writer's meaning. It is a complex system, although little children can learn it pretty quickly.\n","\n","Another remarkable thing about human language is that it is all about symbols. According to Chris Manning, a machine learning professor at Stanford, it is a discrete, symbolic, categorical signaling system. This means we can convey the same meaning in different ways (i.e., speech, gesture, signs, etc.) The encoding by the human brain is a continuous pattern of activation by which the symbols are transmitted via continuous signals of sound and vision.\n","\n","Understanding human language is considered a difficult task due to its complexity. For example, there is an infinite number of different ways to arrange words in a sentence. Also, words can have several meanings and contextual information is necessary to correctly interpret sentences. Every language is more or less unique and ambiguous. Just take a look at the following newspaper headline \"The Popeâs baby steps on gays.\" This sentence clearly has two very different interpretations, which is a pretty good example of the challenges in NLP.\n","\n","Note that a perfect understanding of language by a computer would result in an AI that can process the whole information that is available on the internet, which in turn would probably result in artificial general intelligence.\n","\n","III. SYNTACTIC & SEMANTIC ANALYSIS\n","Syntactic analysis (syntax) and semantic analysis (semantic) are the two primary techniques that lead to the understanding of natural language. Language is a set of valid sentences, but what makes a sentence valid? Syntax and semantics.\n","\n","Syntax is the grammatical structure of the text, whereas semantics is the meaning being conveyed. A sentence that is syntactically correct, however, is not always semantically correct. For example, âcows flow supremelyâ is grammatically valid (subjectâââverbâââadverb) but it doesn't make any sense.\n"],"name":"stdout"},{"output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/ipykernel_launcher.py:1: DeprecationWarning: 'U' mode is deprecated\n","  \"\"\"Entry point for launching an IPython kernel.\n"],"name":"stderr"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"CZzUicUhiH5K","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1619807874198,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":10181,"user":{"displayName":"18_Swapnil Pradeep","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ce1wky-NHO4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAugM/Lfi8GShrm1Y/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"12112827158399341463"}},"outputId":"40a5e7e5-42eb-441c-dff1-cacc24ce5af7"},"source":["s = input(\"Enter some text: \")"],"execution_count":34,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Enter some text: NLP\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"ICUjxMbviIIU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1619807879234,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1126,"user":{"displayName":"18_Swapnil Pradeep","photoUrl":"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ce1wky-NHO4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAugM/Lfi8GShrm1Y/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"12112827158399341463"}},"outputId":"c0696b5a-eb38-4bea-8797-9f894c8c1f93"},"source":["print(\"You typed\", len(word_tokenize(s)), \"words.\")"],"execution_count":35,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["You typed 1 words.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"StyvbMQ6jESu"},"source":["**4.
